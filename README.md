# Parkinson’s Disease Detection Using Spiral Drawing Analysis

##  Overview
This project presents a machine learning–based framework for the early detection of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) using spiral-drawing images. The system leverages handcrafted feature extraction and multiple classification models, followed by a soft-voting ensemble strategy to improve diagnostic reliability.

The proposed approach emphasizes interpretability, robustness, and reproducibility, making it suitable for academic research and practical screening applications.

##  Objectives
- Detect Parkinson’s Disease from spiral-drawing patterns
- Extract interpretable handcrafted features capturing motor irregularities
- Compare multiple classical machine learning models
- Evaluate a proposed ensemble model using **5-fold cross-validation**
- Analyze performance using clinically relevant metrics

##  Dataset
- **Input**: Handcrafted feature vectors extracted from spiral-drawing images  
- **Labels**:  
  - `0` → Healthy  
  - `1` → Parkinson’s Disease  

Features include:
- Statistical descriptors
- Texture features (GLCM)
- Shape descriptors (Hu Moments)
- Edge-based features
